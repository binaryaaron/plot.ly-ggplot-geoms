# compatibility list for Plot.ly and ggplot
[Plotly](http://www.plot.ly) is a cool, open-source project  ( [github](https://github.com/plotly) ) to help people get interactive plots online easily through a number of various programming languages. It's essentially brand new and I'm going to document how well it works with the popular ggplot2 package in R. This document will be updated as support for more geoms is added.

See the file [plotly_examples.md](https://github.com/xysmas/plot.ly-ggplot-geoms/blob/master/plotly_examples.md) for the breakdown here on GitHub or see the post at my [blog](http://aarongonzales.net/2014/04/plotly-and-ggpplot-compatibility/). 

Update - 
A better version of the post with the embedded plot.ly plots can be found [here](http://aarongonzales.net/plotly_examples.html). Wordpress doesn't seem to like my giant html file all that much.
